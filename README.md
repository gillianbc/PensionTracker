# Pension Tracker
Utility app for myself to see if it's easier to record and analyse my pension savings in my own Postgres DB supported by a SpringBoot app rather than the spreadsheet that I've used for years.

# Populating the DB
Use the endpoints to POST into the entities that change infrequently - providers and pension pots
See the http-requests folder for examples.
